#  AI-Minimax-TicTacToe

This repository contains a terminal-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with an **optimal AI agent** implemented using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI never loses â€” it always plays perfectly.



##  Description

This project was created as part of an **Artificial Intelligence course assignment**. It demonstrates how to build a game-playing agent capable of making optimal decisions using a recursive game-tree evaluation.

The game runs in the terminal, allowing a human player to play against the AI.
